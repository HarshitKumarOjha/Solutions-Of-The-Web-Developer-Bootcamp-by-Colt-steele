<!doctype html> : is to indicate that your html file is using html 5

<html> : is the root element

<head> : provides general information (metadata) about the document , title , links ,style sheets , font files
         (basically what we don't see)

<body> : represents the content of an html document.            

comments : <!--    -->

tags : like <h1> <p> <ul>  

block level : which take up their own line
inline : work inside a line

<title> : the search engines shows the name of the webpage as the title. 

<h1> : the most important heading and <h6> is least. (these are block lvl elements)

<p> : represents paragraph of text. Paragraphs are block laevel elements.

<b> : blod tag (inline element) but this is not the best way in html5 to bold 
      so we have to use <strong> which is much more meaning full.

<i> : italicise the text but we will use <em> which is basically same but better.

<b> & <i> : are about the style ... but <strong> & <em> are more about the look.

lists : ordered (numbers) and unordered (bullet pints) lists...lists can be nested.
<ol>
    <li> List Items </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li> List Items </li>
</ul>

<div> : a div is a generic container...basically a way to group things together. (block level element)

<span> : an inline container for grouping/selecting things together.

attributes : additional information to tags 

<tag name="value"></tag>
<img src="corgi.png>
<p class="selected"> woof woof </p>
<a href="www.google.com"> click me to go to google </a>    (inline element)
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

Tables :
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> Table Header 1 </th>
            <th> Table Header 2 </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>    
        <tr>
            <td> Table Data 1 </td>
            <td> Table Data 2 </td>

</table>

Forms : putting input tags inside the Form tags makes a form. form is a block lvl element.
